# Objectives


While language technology achieve impressive results on different tasks, African languages continue to lag behind in the rapid advancements of language technology and its applications.
Aside from the economic benefits, language technologies have far-reaching impacts on societies â€“ facilitating the study and preservation of languages, access to and management of history and culture, and facilitating deeper understanding across people through shared communication. 

The goal of this seminar is to understand the need for language technology, the challenges and opportunities of applying language technology to African languages. By examining the evolution of language technology and its limited application to commercially profitable languages, the course will highlight the need for expansion into other languages for cultural and societal benefits. Students will gain an understanding of  how language technology impacts daily life, through examples like smart devices and virtual agents.
The caurse also aims to explore the typology of African languages, with a specific focus on Swahili covering the basic grammatical and linguistic structure. 
We will introduce language processing using computers covering basic concepts, tools, and applications (search engines, speech processing, machine translation,  text classification, information extraction, and recommendation system) for processing language with computers and inclusivity in content creation through digital orality, which involves using audiovisual technologies in African languages, helping these languages gain prominence in mainstream spaces.

Any course with the phrase *Introduction to* in its title embodies both a curse and a blessing. The curse mostly stems form the overchoice stress experienced by the instructor when they sit down to design the syllabus and undertake the exercise of distilling the essence of a field. Inevitably, this exercise is always a form of self-inquiry.  Particularly for Digital Humanities, this choice-related stress can take on draconian proportions, as the field is often compared to a large, all-welcoming tent (hence our class logo).

Consequently, every *Introduction to Digital Humanities* course is distinct, with each instructor highlighting different aspects. This diversity is precisely what makes it exciting. For students, it presents a crow's nest view of the field, allowing them to survey the landscape and decide which areas they would like to explore further. For instructors, it is an opportunity to reflect on their own practice and to learn from their students' interests.

Our primary goal in this course is thus to provide an introduction, but this does not mean that we will not also acquire very specific knowledge. On a meta-level, our goals are to become adept at independently sourcing necessary information for Digital Humanities-related inquiries and to acquire a number of digital skills. This will be achieved through both theoretical understanding and critical reflection, as well as through interaction with datasets and the use of specific tools. The more concrete goals we have in mind are:

- Understanding the historical, theoretical, and methodological **context** of Digital Humanities as a field of study.
- Applying a range of digital **tools and approaches** to address research questions in the humanities.
- Assessing the **impact and implications** of digital technology on humanities disciplines.
- Engaging critically with the **ethical issues** raised by digital projects in the humanities.
- Developing and **presenting** a Digital Humanities project, demonstrating their understanding of the methodologies, tools, and theoretical perspectives studied in the course.
