# Objectives

Any course with the phrase *Introduction to* in its title embodies both a curse and a blessing. The curse mostly stems form the overchoice stress experienced by the instructor when they sit down to design the course and undertake the exercise of distilling the essence of a field. Inevitably, this exercise is always a form of self-inquiry.  Particularly for Digital Humanities, this choice-related stress can take on draconian proportions, as the field is often compared to a large, all-welcoming tent (hence our class logo).

Consequently, every *Introduction to Digital Humanities* course is distinct, with each instructor highlighting different aspects. This diversity is precisely what makes it exciting. For students, it presents a crow's nest view of the field, allowing them to survey the landscape and decide which areas they would like to explore further. For instructors, it is an opportunity to reflect on their own practice and to learn from their students' interests.

Our primary goal in this course is thus to provide an introduction, but this does not mean that we will not also acquire very specific knowledge. On a meta-level, our goals are to become adept at independently sourcing necessary information for Digital Humanities-related inquiries and to acquire a number of digital skills through hands-on tutorials. This will be achieved through both theoretical understanding and critical reflection, as well as through interaction with datasets and the use of specific tools. The more concrete goals we have in mind are:

- Understanding the historical, theoretical, and methodological **context** of Digital Humanities as a field of study.
- Applying a range of digital **tools and approaches** to address research questions in the humanities.
- Assessing the **impact and implications** of digital technology on humanities disciplines.
- Engaging critically with the **ethical issues** raised by digital projects in the humanities.
- Developing and **presenting** a Digital Humanities project, demonstrating their understanding of the methodologies, tools, and theoretical perspectives studied in the course.
