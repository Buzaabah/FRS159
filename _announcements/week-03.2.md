title: 2/15 CLASS @ MUDD LIBRARY
week: 3
date: 2024-02-14

Hi all --

As you know, our last class had to be canceled due to the snowstorm, which meant we missed out on the opportunity to visit Special Collections at the Mudd Library to see our beloved Princeton Postcards. The good news is that we have rescheduled our visit for tomorrow, February 15th!

Here's a brief recap of the changes and what to expect moving forward:

- Feb. 15: we will meet at the Mudd Library. Please bring along the preparatory work you've already done â€“ it will be relevant for our visit.

- Feb. 20: our Lab on Data Cleaning has been postponed to next week, February 20th. As such, the reading assignments and reflections that were originally due for tomorrow's class are now due before the lab session next week. For those who have already posted their reflections: great! For everyone else, this means you've got some extra time.

- Feb. 22: we'll be back on track with our original schedule by February 22nd, and I'm looking forward to your presentations on your Data Biographies.

Please take a moment to visit the course website where I've posted the [updated schedule](https://whaverals.github.io/IntroDH2024/schedule/). Adjustments have been made to ensure that our learning journey remains smooth and -- until the next snow storm -- uninterrupted.

Thank you all for your understanding and flexibility! I appreciate your commitment to adapting alongside these minor changes.
