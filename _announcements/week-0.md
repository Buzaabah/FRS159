Hello students --
 
Welcome to Princeton! I am looking forward to meeting you and I hope you are eager for the adventures ahead. 

Meeting location coming soon..

The first session of our meeting will be about knowing each other and to go over the contents of our course. The session will be an opportunity for us to become acquainted, discussing our interests, backgrounds, and what we hope to achieve by the end of the course.
  
Should you have any questions or concerns before our first meeting, feel free to reach out.

-- Happy
