## Term Assignments (70%)

### Engagement with Materials (30%)

Throughout the course, you will be actively engaging with a wide range of assigned materials, including book chapters, academic articles, project websites, podcasts, videos, essays, and datasets. This engagement involves a two-step process: firstly, by commenting on _Perusall_, and secondly, by reflecting on your insights on slack. 

**1. Commenting on _Perusall_** (10%)

Engage with the assigned materials on the collaborative annotation platform [_Perusall_](https://app.perusall.com/). Make sure to read, watch, or listen to the materials thoroughly. _Perusall_ allows you to highlight passages, make comments, and respond to your peers' comments and questions. Please be courteous and constructive during these interactions, adhering to the same [etiquette guidelines](https://whaverals.github.io/IntroDH2024/policies/#class-etiquette) as our class interactions.

- **Frequency of Engagement**: Unless otherwise noted, you should complete a minimum of three annotations per assigned material (i.e. per article, chapter, video, etc.) by 9:00AM on the day of our class.
- **Nature of Comments**: Your comment can be an agreement, disagreement, expression of confusion, question, or any other relevant observation. There are no right or wrong comments. The interaction serves as an exercise in critical thinking, collaborative learning, and engagement with scientific debates.

**2. Reflecting on _Slack_** (10%)

After your interaction on _Perusall_, **post an overall reflection** in the [#reflections](https://introtodh--spring2024.slack.com/archives/C06F1KS1ULT) channel on _Slack_. Reflect on the entirety of your engagement with the materials. Some possibly helpful questions to guide you:

- What connections do you identify across the assigned materials?
- If specific arguments or points are being raised, do they overlap or contrast with each other?
- Are there elements that particularly inspired or frustrated you? Which ones and why?
- What parts of the assigned materials were confusing or challenging to understand?
- Are there specific topics you are now interested in exploring further?

A paragraph of 200-300 words is sufficient for your reflection. You are welcome to write more, but please keep in mind that the goal is to reflect on the materials, not to summarize them. If you are unsure about the length of your reflection, please feel free to ask me. Your grade will be determined by the depth and quality of your reflections, focusing on your critical engagement with the readings rather than agreement with their content.

**Deadline**: Please ensure both your annotations (min. 3 per assigned material) on _Perusall_ and your reflection on _Slack_ are submitted by 9:00AM on the day of our class.


### Participation (15%)

Class participation is an important aspect of this course. During the discussion and presentation sessions you are expected to **contribute at least once**. It might be intimidating to speak up sometimes, however, you should be assured that your contributions are valuable. Diverse viewpoints and genuine dialogue are what make our discussions thrive. Please respect the [classroom etiquette](https://buzaabah.github.io/FRS159/policies/#class-etiquette) while sharing your thoughts.

### Presentations (15%)

Throughout this course, there will be opportunities to present your work. These will include, reading an article and present plus your final paper project.

## Midterm
There will be a mid-term exam which will account for 20%
## Final Assignment (30%)
TBA
