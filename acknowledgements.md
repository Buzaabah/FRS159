## Acknowledgments

This syllabus has drawn inspiration from the teaching materials of many others. Among the syllabi referenced while developing this course are other courses entitled "Introduction to Digital Humanities," including those by [Kristen Mapes and Kate Topham](https://msuintrodhfall2020.hcommons.org/), [Zoe LeBlanc](https://zoeleblanc.com/IntroToDH2020/), [Miriam Posner](https://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w23/), [Sierra Eckert](https://sceckert.github.io/IntroDHSpring2021/), and [Ryan Cordell](https://f20idh.ryancordell.org/). Other courses that have been consulted include [Meredith Martin and Rebecca Munson's "Literature, Data, and Interpretation"](https://humstudies.princeton.edu/courses/literature-data-and-interpretation/), [Melanie Walsh's "Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python"](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html), and the case studies-based handbook ["Humanities Data Analysis"](https://www.humanitiesdataanalysis.org/) by Folgert Karsdorp, Mike Kestemont, and Allen Riddell.

Additionally, the following books have been wonderfully instrumental in designing this course:

- Gardiner, Eileen, and Ronald G. Musto. _The Digital Humanities. A Primer for Students and Scholars_. Cambridge University Press, 2015.
- Drucker, Johanna. _The Digital Humanities Coursebook. An Introduction to Digital Methods for Research and Scholarship_. Routledge/Taylor & Francis, 2021.
- Karsdorp, Folgert, et al. _Humanities Data Analysis. Case Studies with Python_. Princeton University Press, 2021.
- Croxall, Brian, and Diane K. Jakacki (editors). _What We Teach When We Teach DH: Digital Humanities in the Classroom_. University of Minnesota Press, 2023.

Also a huge shout out to [my friends at the CDH](https://cdh.princeton.edu/people/staff/) for their support, answering my (many, many) questions, inspiring chats, and just being all-around awesome. Thanks also to my friends at [ACDC](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/digitalhumanities/) for reviewing prior versions of this syllabus and providing valuable feedback.
