## Datasets

There are some great datasets out there! In this course, we will encounter and play with some of the ones listed here below. It goes without saying that it is impossible for this list to be exhaustive. Look at it as a point of reference, but perhaps more so as a place of inspiration. If you come across a dataset that you want to share with the class, do let me know, and  I'll make sure to add it to the list.

One way to find datasets is to use a dedicated search engine like the [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). Another place where datasets can be found is on GitHub, where you can search for datasets by using the  search query `topic:dataset`.

Finally, it is worth noting that other people or groups of people have built excellent lists of datasets:

- Sierra Eckert
- Melanie Walsh has compiled a great [list of links to datasets](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/blob/master/book/Datasets/Datasets.ipynb), including a dataset of Nobel Laureates 1901-2017), a dataset of dialogue in 2,000 Hollywood films, a collection of European novels, a collection of Colonial South Asian literature, network data about Game of Thrones Character relationships), an archive of Donald Trump's Tweets, and all the obituaries published in the NYTimes from 1852-2007
- Miriam Posner's [list of datasets](http://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w21/final-project/datasets/) for her graduate course.
