title: Week 7 - Dive into Data, Part IV -- Social Network Analysiss
---

In our fourth data analysis module, we will focus on the the field of Social Network Analysis. Using the open-source software package Gephi, we will scrutinize character interactions in an innovative manner. Our investigation will center on fan-fiction data sourced from the Archive Of Our Own platform. Using Gephi, we will look into the intriguing phenomenon of ‘fandom fusion’ – a practice where fans intricately intertwine elements from different fandoms in their writing.
