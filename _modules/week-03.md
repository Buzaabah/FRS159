title: Week 3 - A Project of Our Own
---

In this module, we will start on our class-crowdsourced project featuring a dataset that captures the essence of Princeton University: the Princeton University Historical Postcard Collection. Part of this collection has been digitized and is available through the [Princeton University Digital Library](https://dpul.princeton.edu/collections/7d278t50j). We will outline the various stages of this project, from conception to completion, and identify the tools and techniques that will assist us throughout. We will also pay a visit to the [Mudd Library](https://library.princeton.edu/special-collections) where we will view the collection up close. In the second meeting of this week, students will present their analysis of a self-selected DH dataset and project.
