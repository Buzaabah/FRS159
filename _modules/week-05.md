title: Week 5 - Text Digitization and Content Management
---

During our first session this week, we will look at  into the technology behind making text digitally readable. Our historic postcard collection provides the perfect case study for exploring both Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) technologies. In our subsequent session, we will explore the concept of Content Management Systems (CMS) and how they can be used to manage, present, and narrate digital content. We will evaluate different types of CMS platforms and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.
