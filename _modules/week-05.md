- Pre-Class Reflection:
- [Speech and Language Processing, An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition with Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book.pdf) Third Edition by Daniel Jurafsky, James H. Martin. 
    - Read Chapter 2, and try to answer the following; what is a document and document segmentation? what is a sentence and sentence segmentation? what do you understand by a corpora, what is tokenization? Explain these terms; stopwords, stemming, lemmatization.
    - Read Chapter 13 to have a broad understanding of the Applications of NLP, no need to understand the technical details.

- Read through the following papers, summerise in one page your key takeaway from the paper. You don't have to understand everything.
