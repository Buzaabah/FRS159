---

Our second hands-on tutorial will venture into the realm of Spatial Humanities and the Geographic Information System (GIS). Students will become acquainted with the transformative effects of the ‘Spatial Turn’ in Humanities, specifically highlighting the potential of GIS technology. Our practical component will center around QGIS, an open-source GIS application. Utilizing historical maps from the Princeton University Campus, we will georeference these materials and superimpose them with other data to identify and interpret changes over time.
