- Reflection:
  - Read about data annotation and data labeling through this [blog](https://toloka.ai/blog/annotation-vs-labeling/), summerise in one paragraph what is annotation and why it is necessary.
  - [Adelani et al., MasakhaNER: Named Entity Recognition for African Languages](https://app.perusall.com/courses/training-computers-to-understand-african-languages/masakhaner). Read abstract, section 3 of focus languages and section 4 about the Data and annotation methodology.
  - [Cheikh et al., MasakhaPOS: Part-of-Speech Tagging for Typologically Diverse African Languages](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.609.pdf). Read the abstract, all of section 4 about data and annotation and section 5 annotation challenges.
- We will practice using [African language text corpus](https://github.com/masakhane-io/lacuna_pos_ner/tree/main/language_corpus)  to annotate African languages.
- We will use an [external annotation tool](https://tecoholic.github.io/ner-annotator/) to annotate Named Entities in African languages text.
