title: Week 12 - Project presentations
---
<!-- In this concluding week, we begin by exploring the ethical dimensions of Digital Humanities, with a focus on critical issues such as algorithmic bias and transparency in the age of AI. We confront these developments by analyzing their impacts, potential, and the risks they create. In the final session, students will showcase the progress of their own research proposals, which involves elements of data collection, preparation, and analysis methods. Colleagues from the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton University are invited, providing an opportunity for everyone to gain feedback on their proposals.
