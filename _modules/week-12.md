title: Week 12 - Digital Humanities -- Future Directions and Project Exhibition
---

In our final module, we create a space for dialogue and intellectual exchange. This module is divided into two sections. In the first part, students will showcase the progress of their final assignments. They will illustrate a digital research project which involves elements of data collection, preparation, and analysis methods. Moreover, they will discuss how these elements aid them in answering specific research questions or testing a hypothesis, while also reflecting on the ethical aspects of their project. For the second part, colleagues from the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton University are invited for a round-table discussion, providing an opportunity for students to interact, inquire, and gain insights into the ever evolving field of Digital Humanities.
