title: Week 11 - Going beyond text processing; complexities of spoken language
---

<!-- This week, we will look at the role of coding in the humanities with a gentle introduction to Python, a programming language as approachable as it is powerful. Our two sessions will provide a panoramic view of Python's syntax and its practical applications in Humanities research. Through hands-on exercises, we'll learn to appreciate the role of code in analyzing texts, visualizing data, and perhaps most importantly, in sharpening our critical thinking about coding literacy. Ultimately, the goal of this week is to get a taste of programming in Python, with fear being an exception that is not allowed to interrupt the process.

Or, stated in a Pythonic way:

```python
try:
    learn_python()
except Fear as obstacle:
    handle(obstacle)  # apply strategies to overcome fear
else:
    print('Congratulations on embracing coding literacy!')  # celebrate
```
