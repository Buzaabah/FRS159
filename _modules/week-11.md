title: Week 11 - Going beyond text processing; complexities of spoken language
---

One of the earliest goals of language processing in computers is to understand spoken language. This module will introduce Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS) and how to build speech recognition systems for African languages.



<!-- This week, we will look at the role of coding in the humanities with a gentle introduction to Python, a programming language as approachable as it is powerful. Our two sessions will provide a panoramic view of Python's syntax and its practical applications in Humanities research. Through hands-on exercises, we'll learn to appreciate the role of code in analyzing texts, visualizing data, and perhaps most importantly, in sharpening our critical thinking about coding literacy. Ultimately, the goal of this week is to get a taste of programming in Python, with fear being an exception that is not allowed to interrupt the process.

Or, stated in a Pythonic way:

```python
try:
    learn_python()
except Fear as obstacle:
    handle(obstacle)  # apply strategies to overcome fear
else:
    print('Congratulations on embracing coding literacy!')  # celebrate
```

- Readings:
  - [Speech and Language Processing, An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition with Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/16.pdf) Third Edition by Daniel Jurafsky, James H. Martin. 
    - Read Chapter 16 about automatic speech recognition (ASR), text to speech (TTS) and other speech tasks.

- [Nabende et al., Building Text and Speech Benchmark Datasets and Models for Low-Resourced East African Languages: Experiences and Lessons](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ail2.92). Read from abstract to section 4 about named entity for African languages.
    Read from abastract to section 7, you can leave section 8 of the models and experiments but read section 9 about the experiences, challenges, and lessons learned.
