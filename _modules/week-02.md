This week we survey the expansive terrain of Digital Humanities. First, we'll engage in a discussion on 'data' as a core concepts, and the methodologies that propel the field forward. Later on this week, we focus on practical applications, examining real-world examples.

- Pre-Class Exercise:
  - Play around with [Google's Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) to investigate two terms of your choice (e.g. 'car' vs. 'automobile'). Analyze and interpret the trends you observe. Consider the following: what intriguing patterns -- if any -- emerge? Can specific historical events explain shifts in the usage of these terms? You are welcome to do a quick online search to support your interpretations, but keep it concise -- no more than three sentences for each term.
  - **Post your analysis your along with a screenshot of your NGram search in the** <a href="https://introtodh--spring2024.slack.com/archives/C06FSP0UUEQ" style="color: #ee6374;">**#ngrams** </a>**channel on Slack** <a style="color: #ee6374;">**before 9am on the day of our class.**</a>

<!-- Look at one example of a digital humanities project and see if you can describe it in terms of the basic components of materials, processing, and presentation.

Ulysses Project: (developed by @frabbitry and team: a study of how James Joyce's Ulysses associated various locations in the city of Dublin with literary and mythic allusions. Creates a map as guide to parts of Dublin that are associated with passages in Ulysses.)

The Hamilton Project: (Greensburg project with lots of network visualizations and a graph of motifs and their frequency of repetition in the musical Hamilton)

Profanities in Quentin Tarantino's Screenplays (Pittsburgh student project, with network analysis of offensive language spoken by/to male and female characters)


La Lega Toscana Protezione multi-semester Pitt/newtfire project by @zme1 studying English-Italian language adaptation and membership in a Pittsburgh Italian society, with a terrific range of graph types.

Write up a 500-word blog post about the project you chose, describing it in terms of the basic components of materials, processing, and presentation. What materials are used? How are they processed? How are they presented? What do you think is the most interesting aspect of the project? What do you think is the most challenging aspect of the project? What do you think is the most successful aspect of the project? What do you think is the least successful aspect of the project? What would you do differently if you were to do a similar project? -->
