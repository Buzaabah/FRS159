title: Week 10 - Bridging the language barrier using machine translation
---

<!-- This week, we continue our exploration of visualization in Digital Humanities with a focus on network analysis. Building on our discussion on data visualization, we'll look at web-based platforms like [_Flourish_](https://flourish.studio/) and software like [_Gephi_](https://gephi.org/) and learn how network analysis provides valuable insights into relational data. In the latter part of the week, we shift our attention to critical issues such as copyright, fair use, and the principles of open access.

Translation, in its full generality, such as the translation of literature, or poetry, is a difficult, fascinating, and intensely human endeavor, as rich as any other
area of human creativity. This module introduces machine translation (MT), the use of computers to translate from one language to another.
