title: Week 10 - Network Analysis and Intellectual Property Rights
---

This week, we continue our exploration of visualization in Digital Humanities with a focus on network analysis. Building on our discussion on data visualization, we'll look at web-based platforms like [_Flourish_](https://flourish.studio/) and software like [_Gephi_](https://gephi.org/) and learn how network analysis provides valuable insights into relational data. In the latter part of the week, we shift our attention to critical issues such as copyright, fair use, and the principles of open access.
