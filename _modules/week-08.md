title: Week 8 - Dive into Data, Part V -- Digital Tools for Visual Analysis
---

In this final tutorial, you will learn how to apply digital methods for examining images, detecting visual patterns and variations, and developing research questions and hypotheses based on your results. Our practical workshop uses PixPlot, which lets us see and analyze a large number of images. We will compare different image collections â€“ such as paintings from various periods or genres, photographs showing different regions or cultures, and book covers from different genres.
