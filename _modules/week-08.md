title: Week 8 - Information Retrieval
---

<!-- In this module, we will discover the world of stylometry, a field that probes the unique stylistic fingerprint of authors. Utilizing the user-friendly package [Stylo](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016/RJ-2016-007/index.html), we will undertake a critical review and replication of Patrick Juolaâ€™s study (2013), which aimed to reveal the author hiding behind the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. In doing so, we will not only explore the power of stylometric techniques, but also discuss the broader implications of this type of research, emphasizing the ethical and scholarly consequences.

As soon as computers were inveted we were asking them questions, because we need to know things. Systems in the early 1960s were answering questions about baseball statistics and scientific facts.
In this module we will have a sufficient overview of Information extraction and its applications to question answering.
