title: Week 4 - Molding and Modeling Data
---

In this module, we investigate the critical procedures involved in cleaning and annotating data, thereby preparing it for analysis. These processes invariably entail the making of mindful decisions. As we gear up for the hands-on tutorials, we also explore an integral component of data analysis: data modeling. We will demystify this process, its bearing on our data handling techniques, and what constitutes an effective data model.
