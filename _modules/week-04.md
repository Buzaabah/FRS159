- Practice annotation:
  - We will practice using [African language text corpus](https://github.com/masakhane-io/lacuna_pos_ner/tree/main/language_corpus)  to annotate African languages.
  - We will use an [external annotation tool](https://tecoholic.github.io/ner-annotator/) to annotate Named Entities in African languages text.
