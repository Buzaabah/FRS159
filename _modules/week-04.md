---

It is common for people to use NLP technology every day without even knowing it. For example, Google Search knows what you're looking for through either text or speech,
Gmail generates smart reply responses based on messages etc. This module will introduce NLP and its applications.

- [Slides coming soon]
- Pre-Class Reflection:
- [Chapter 2: Speech and Language Processing, An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition with Language Models](https://app.perusall.com/courses/training-computers-to-understand-african-languages/_/dashboard/documents/document-rb5YyN2Er4qsYW9nE) Third Edition by Daniel Jurafsky, James H. Martin. 
    - Try to answer the following; what is a document and document segmentation? what is a sentence and sentence segmentation? what do you understand by a corpora, what is tokenization? Explain these terms; stopwords, stemming, lemmatization.
    - Skim through Chapters 13,14, 15 and 16 to have a broad understanding of the Applications of NLP, no need to understand the technical details.

- Practice annotation:
  - We will practice using [African language text corpus](https://github.com/masakhane-io/lacuna_pos_ner/tree/main/language_corpus)  to annotate African languages.
  - We will use an [external annotation tool](https://tecoholic.github.io/ner-annotator/) to annotate Named Entities in African languages text.
  


- Presentation overview:
  - On this day, students will present their Data Biographies. This is a chance to share the intriguing stories behind the datasets you've explored!
  - Each presentation should last approximately -- but also no more than -- **4 minutes**, followed by a brief (~1 minute) Q&A session.
  - Focus on the **narrative** of your Data Biography, presenting on aspects you find interesting, such as origin, collector(s), collection method(s), intended use, and any limitations or ethical considerations.
  - Use visuals or excerpts from your dataset to illustrate your points and engage the audience.
  - For more details, refer to the [assignment description](https://whaverals.github.io/IntroDH2024/assignments/).
- Presentation guidelines:
  - Maximum of **five (5) slides** per presentation.
  - Please add your slides to [this shared slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mTgty4Mz-QqjX4BsHRMptukM-UFkppUwzIpYSDEeUT0/edit?usp=sharing) before the start of the class.
  - Strict time limit of **four (4) minutes** for each presentation.
