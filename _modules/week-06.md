title: Week 6 - Dive into Data, Part III -- Stylometry
---

In our third hands-on tutorial, we will discover the world of stylometry, a field that probes the unique stylistic fingerprint of authors. Utilizing the user-friendly package Stylo, we will undertake a critical review and replication of Juolaâ€™s study (2013), which aimed to reveal the author hiding behind the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. In doing so, we will not only explore the power of stylometric techniques, but also discuss the broader implications of this type of research, emphasizing the ethical and scholarly consequences.
