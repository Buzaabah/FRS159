title: Week 9 - The movie was okay â€“ analyzing the sentiment of texts
---
This module focuses on the visual dimension of Digital Humanities research. Often, the dissemination of results takes the form of graphs or they are displayed via graphical interfaces. We will explore a whole spectrum of data visualization practices, citing examples of the good, the bad, and even the downright ugly. In this sense, the session is aimed to prepare us for the coming labs on mapping and network analysis.
