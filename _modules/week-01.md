title: WEEK 1 - Intro to and Foundations of Digital Humanities

In this module, we explore the contours that delineate the field known as Digital Humanities. We discuss what are the essential or minimal ingredients, and critically examine various definitions. We traverse the landscape of Digital Humanities and explore how early definitions of the field differ from more recent attempts at defining it.
