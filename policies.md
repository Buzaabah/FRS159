# Course Policies and Expectations

## Reading

Almost every week, we will read key texts that touch upon important themes on developing technology, highlight specific projects, or introduce a technique/methodology. Needless to say, these readings are crucial. They not only prepare you for the content of the lessons (I expect you be familiar with them) but also set the stage for our discussions. All texts will be made available through the online platform [Perusall](https://www.perusall.com/), which enables collaborative reading. You will be able to annotate the texts and comment on each other’s annotations. I will also be able to see your annotations and comments, which will help me to prepare for our discussions.

## Class Meeting Types

## Attendance and Participation

Many sessions in this seminar will be discussion-based, where active participation is essential. Your responsibility includes **arriving on time, completing the readings and exercises, and being prepared for class discussions and activities**.

I understand that unavoidable situations can arise: sometimes life just happens. **If you must miss a class, please try to inform me in advance.** Absences may impact your grade, except in the case of medical or personal emergencies or attending/traveling to/from varsity competitions.

## Slack

While our course takes place in person, we will use _Slack_ as an additional communication platform. It serves as a space for posting [reflections](https://join.slack.com/t/frs159/shared_invite/zt-2pl1avtc5-R7ls3K~lDgq02kPn7iVTpA) on the assigned materials, sharing resources, like files and links. Make sure you join our _Slack_ workspace by using the invitation link provided in class!

## Office Hours

I'm available for office hours every Wednesday from 1:00-2:00pm at the [Tiger Tea Room](https://dining.princeton.edu/locations-hours/tiger-tea-room#:-:text=tiger%20tea%20room). Office hours are a great chance for us to discuss anything related to the class – be it readings, assignments, feedback, challenging concepts. I'm also happy to chat about your interests in Technology for African languages, or to help you find resources for your study. If you can't make it to office hours, feel free to email me to set up an appointment.

## Class Etiquette

In order to create a productive and respectful learning environment, let's observe the following guidelines:

- Aim to thoughtfully contribute to our discussions at least once every class. If you find class participation intimidating or difficult for any reason, please discuss this with me during office hours early in the semester. Together, we can work on improving your participation skills and set achievable goals.

- Arrive on time and be ready to actively engage in class discussions and exercises.

- When responding to a classmate, be respectful and constructive. If you disagree with their viewpoint, explain why and provide evidence to support your argument.

- If you often contribute, consider stepping back occasionally to let others speak.

- Address your classmates by their preferred names and be mindful not to make assumptions about gender pronouns.

- Given the digital nature of our course, it's important to create an environment with minimal distractions. During class -- whether in discussions, hands-on labs, group work, solo activities, or presentations -- please keep only relevant course material tabs open on your browser. Refrain from browsing social media, checking emails, or messaging during class to maintain focus.

## Health and Wellness

Your well-being is important. If you're experiencing challenges affecting your health -- be it physical, emotional, or mental -- Princeton University offers extensive support. The [Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)](https://uhs.princeton.edu/counseling-psychological-services) provides free counseling, group support, and more, all adhering to [strict confidentiality standards](https://uhs.princeton.edu/counseling-psychological-services/counseling/confidentiality-cps).

## Equipment

Since our sessions will involve working with digital tools, **you will need a laptop** for this course. If you do not have one, please let me know as soon as possible. I will do my best to help you find a solution!

## AI Assistance

For a fair evaluation of your work, it is imperative to exercise honesty. All resources including generetive AI should be used in a responsible manner that aligns with the Honor Code of Princeton University **[Princeton University’s academic regulations](https://rrr.princeton.edu/2022/students-and-university/24-academic-regulations)**.

Using generative AI should be seen as an opportunity to enhance your learning and understanding, rather than a shortcut to completing assignments. It is a tool for exploration, only use it to complement **your learning**.

## COVID Protocol

If you test positive for COVID, please stay home! Inform me, and we will arrange -- if possible -- a semi-hybrid option.
